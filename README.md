## Love Games

Small repo of various scripts used by myself to mess around with or make small
games with the intent to learn the LOVE 2D game engine. For any of these, just link the file to
main.lua and then run love from this directory.

### Games

1. breakout.lua - Minimal implementation of the game Breakout
2. grow.lua - From one of the website tutorials, a growing rectangle
3. hello.lua - Basic Hello World
4. image.lua - Display an image
6. physics-tutorial.lua - From the website, love.physics tutorial (ball and blocks in world)
7. pong.lua - Minimal implementation of the game Pong
8. sound.lua - Play a basic sound from a file
